# joomla_plg_rjuserd
This is mostly a replacement for the rjuserdata library. The default location for user and group data involved with my suite of user-centric extensions is in \<JPATH_SITE\>/userstor. This plugin allows controlling that location, moving data when changed. It also will accomplish removing the accumulated data when a user or group is deleted.
