# joomla_plg_rjuserd
This is mostly a replacement for the rjuserdata library. The default location for user data involved with my group of user-centric extensions is in <JPATH_SITE>/userstor. This plugin allows controlling that location, moving data when changed. It also will accomplish removing a user's accumulated data when the user is deleted.
